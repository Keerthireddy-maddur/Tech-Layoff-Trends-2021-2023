# Tech Layoff Trends 2021-2023: Insights on Funding, Workforce Planning, and Market Resilience


Imagine waking up to an email informing you that you've been laid off. No warning, no explanation—just a job loss. In 2023, this became a devastating reality for over 200,000 employees across the tech industry. But what drove these layoffs, and what patterns can we identify from this widespread trend?

## Data Analysis Overview
To explore this, I analyzed a dataset of global layoffs from 2021 to 2023. The data covers layoffs across various industries, company stages, and locations. However, before diving into the analysis, I had to clean the dataset—removing duplicate entries, addressing missing values, and standardizing inconsistent formats to ensure accuracy.

## Key Insights from the Data
Once the data was cleaned, the story began to unfold:

### 1.Massive layoffs weren't exclusive to struggling startups.
  Some of the biggest companies—those with billions of dollars raised—were laying off employees just as aggressively as smaller, less-established firms. For example, Quibi, which raised over $2 billion, shut down 
  completely, resulting in a 100% layoff rate. This demonstrated that funding alone isn't enough to guarantee survival in today's volatile market.

### 2.2023 saw the highest number of layoffs, especially in January.
  The United States led the world in layoffs, with tech and media industries bearing the brunt. Surprisingly, companies in later funding stages (like those post-IPO) also experienced significant layoffs, proving 
  that even well-established companies aren’t immune to market shifts.

### 3.San Francisco Bay Area was heavily impacted.
  A shocking 30 companies in the region laid off all of their employees, indicating a significant concentration of layoffs in that location.

## Top Layoff Companies:
- Amazon
- Google
- Meta
- Microsoft
- Ericsson

These companies topped the charts for the highest total layoffs, with Amazon leading the way with 18,150 layoffs over the last three years.

## Key Takeaways & Lessons Learned
-This analysis reveals an important lesson—businesses must prioritize more than just securing funding. It’s essential to build sustainable business models, implement adaptable workforce strategies, and ensure 
 market resilience. Companies that focus on financial sustainability and strategic workforce planning are more likely to weather future challenges and emerge stronger.

-The layoff crisis of 2023 underscores the need for companies to not only innovate but also to plan effectively for long-term success. Companies that understand the importance of building a robust and adaptable 
 workforce will be better equipped to navigate uncertainty and sustain growth in a constantly evolving market.
